# Blackjack AI Project

## 🃏 Overview

This project uses **YOLO-based computer vision** for card recognition and **card counting** strategies to develop a Blackjack AI card counter. The goal is to identify cards accurately and to help the player make the best moves.

## 🚀 Features

- **Card Detection**: Real-time card recognition from camera or screen using YOLO.
- **Card Counting**: Implements a basic counting strategy for gameplay optimization.

## 🛠️ Libraries
- **YOLO (ultralytics)**: Core for card detection. 
- **OpenCV**: Essential for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations used in image processing.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.
- **mss**: For screen capturing.
- **pywin32 (win32gui, win32con, win32ui, win32api)**: For drawing the poker card bounding boxes on the screen.

## 🔧 Usage

## 📝 Next Steps
- Improve card detection under challenging conditions.
- Apply card counting for multi-deck games.
